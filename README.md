#An Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms Using the Iris Dataset
This is a mini project I completed upon finishing Andrew Ng's machine learning course on coursera. I built from scratch 3 machine learning algorithms and used them on the famous iris dataset. I did this to develop my understanding of these algorithms as well as compare them. The three algorithms used were: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and K-Means. I then compared the accuracy of the first two algorithms aswell as the rand index and adjusted rand index (RI and ARI respectivley) of K-Means. I am currently working on a formal write up of my results and understandings which will be uploaded as soon as it's completed.

There are a couple SVM functions which I used directly from the course. I did this as this was advised during the course when using SVM, these were created by Andrew Ng.

Run the iris.m file if you wish to run this program.
